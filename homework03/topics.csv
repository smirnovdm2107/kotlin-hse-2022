I am trying to track any changes to a classes properties, but my solution doesn't work along with kotlinx serialization, and I'm looking for ideas.  


Here is a minimum working example.  


    import kotlinx.serialization.*
    import kotlinx.serialization.json.Json
    import kotlin.properties.Delegates
    
    
    fun main() {
        val dummy = DummyObject("hello!")
    
        dummy.prop = "Hey!"
    
        println(dummy.changedFields)
        println(Json.encodeToString(dummy))
    
        dummy.prop = "Bye!"
    
        println(dummy.changedFields)
        println(Json.encodeToString(dummy))
    
    }
    
    
    @Serializable
    class DummyObject(
        @SerialName("prop")
        private var prop1: String
        ){
    
        var prop by Delegates.observable(prop1){property, oldValue, newValue -&gt;
            if (oldValue != newValue){
                changedFields[property.name] = newValue
            }
        }
    
        @Transient
        var changedFields = mutableMapOf&lt;String, String&gt;()
    
    }

  
The output is as follows  


    {prop=Hey!}
    
    {"prop":"hello!"}
    
    {prop=Bye!}
    
    {"prop":"hello!"}


  


Changes to `prop`  are tracked correctly, however the value that is serialized is only ever the initial value of the constructor(i.e prop1).  


Is there a way to do  it such that any changes are reflected in the Map and in the Json output?

&amp;#x200B;

To be clear, `prop` and `prop1` are being used here as that was the onl way I could see thatmight work with Obseravables, but these are the same property, someones first name for example.

How does the kotlin compiler unambiguously parse an expression which contains generic arguments - how can it tell when a '&lt;' is a delimiter for a generic arguments and when is is a less than?

Think of

    somefunc( andrew&lt;bill, charlie&gt;(david) )

and

    somefunc( mapOf&lt;Cat,Dog&gt;(somePair) )

Both have the same form at the parsing stage before any type information is available.

      somefunc( identifier&lt;identifier,identifier&gt;(identifier) ).

How does the compiler resolve this ambiguity?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:

&amp;#x200B;

I just tried doing some experiments - and the compiler does actually get confused!! Although its a pretty contrived example that I don't think would come up too often in the real world. :-)

It looks like what is happening is the compiler first attempts to interpret '&lt;' as a generic and if it can reach a '&gt;' without hitting a syntax error then accepts that parse, otherwise backtracks and tries interpreting the '&lt;' as a less than.

So this gives some circumstances where a less than is syntactically correct but a greater than isn't (and vice versa)!

    private fun testFunc(a:Boolean, b:Boolean) : Boolean {
         return a &amp;&amp; b

I do acknowledge apprehensions of programmers. My plans are solid backed up by already existing systems. Building an app would ensure smoother operations of the existing systems and hence, i would be  able to share part revenue with the person who does programming.
